# Virtual-CPU-Scheduler-on-Top-of-Linux-using-Threads
 virtual CPU scheduler on top of the Linux kernel using multi-threading, and run a synthetic job mix on the scheduler

 Specifications:


1 - Read an integer N, and create N concurrent threads T1, T2, â€¦, TN that will be scheduled by the virtual scheduler. Each thread will be generating 1000 random integers, sort them, and wait for a random time interval between 1 and 10 seconds before terminating. These N threads are referred to as WORKER threads.

2 - Each of the threads will be having signal handlers installed for handling the user-defined signals SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2. SIGUSR1 will be used to put the thread to sleep, while SIGUSR2 will be used to wake up the thread to resume execution. The running status of all the threads will be stored in a shared data structure called STATUS.

3 - Another thread will be created, called the SCHEDULER thread, which will be sending appropriate signals to the N worker threads. It will implement a round-robin scheduling algorithm with a time quantum of 1 second. It will cyclically run one of the N threads at a time, while the other N-1 threads will be put to sleep. During context switch, the currently running thread will be put to sleep, while the next thread in the READY queue will be woken up.

4 - Another thread will be created, called REPORTER thread, which will continuously monitor the STATUS data structure, and print relevant messages on the screen whenever a context switch or thread termination takes place.
